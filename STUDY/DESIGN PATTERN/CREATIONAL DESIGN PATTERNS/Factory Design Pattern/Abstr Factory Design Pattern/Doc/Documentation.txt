What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern?

According to Gang of 4 definition provide a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

In Simple words, Abstract Factory is a super factory that creates other factories. This factory is also called Factory of factories.

Implementation of Abstract Factory Desig Pattern:

1. Creating Abstract Product.

Create an Interface, this interface declare the method of the Product.

2. Create concret products.

This is the classes that implements the Abstract Factory Interface to create concret products.

3. Creating the Abstract Factory.

AbstractFactory declares an interface for creating families of related dependent objects (Concret Factories) without specifying their concrete classes (Concrete Products).

In the example, The GetAnimal method is an abstract method that is going to be implemented by the child factory classes. 
The CreateAnimalFactory method takes an input parameter i.e. factory type and then creates and returns the appropriate factory object to the caller.

4. Creating Concret Factory.

This is a class that implements the Abstract Factory class. n our example, this class is going to implement the GetAnimal method of Animal factory class. 
There are two types of concrete abstract factories in our example i.e. LandAnimalfactory and SeaAnimalfactory.
In the example project, the GetAnimal method creates and return the appropriate Land Animal object (i.e. Dog, cat, and Lion) based on the input parameter.
the same for Sea Animal object.

5. Client.

The client use the Abstract Factory and Abtract Product Interface to create a family of related objects.
