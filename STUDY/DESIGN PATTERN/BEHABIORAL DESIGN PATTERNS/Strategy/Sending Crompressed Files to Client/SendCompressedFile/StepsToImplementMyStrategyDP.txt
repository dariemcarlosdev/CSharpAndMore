1- Create an Abstract Strategy. (Using Interfaces)
Strategy (ICompression): The Strategy declares an interface that is going to be implemented by all supported algorithms.

2- Creating concrete Strategy.
ConcreteStrategy (RarCompression and ZipCompression): These are classes and they implement the algorithm defined by the Strategy (ICompression) interface.

3- Creating context.
Context (CompressionContext): This is a class which maintains a reference to a Strategy object, and then uses that reference to call the algorithm defined by a particular ConcreteStrategy (i.e. either RarCompression or ZipCompression).

4.Client.
