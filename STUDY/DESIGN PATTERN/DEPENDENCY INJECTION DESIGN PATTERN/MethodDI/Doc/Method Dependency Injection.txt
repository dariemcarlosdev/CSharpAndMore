What is Method Dependency Injection in C#?

In Method Dependency Injection, we need to supply the dependency object through a public method of the client class. 

When do we need to use the Method Dependency Injection in C#?

when the entire class does not depend on the dependency object but, a single method of that class depends on the dependency object.
